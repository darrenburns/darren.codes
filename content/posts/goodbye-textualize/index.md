After three years of working full-time on Textual, it's finally time to move on and find a new challenge.

Over the course of three years, I've worked with some amazing colleagues, been part of a fantastic community of open-source developers, and had the opportunity to work on the most interesting projects of my career so far. We took Textual from a proof-of-concept to version 1.0 - a fully-featured open-source TUI framework - which can be used to build apps that push the boundaries of what is possible in the terminal. I feel incredibly privileged to have been involved in such a project. Despite no longer working full-time on it, I'll likely remain active in the community, albeit at a far reduced capacity.

What's next for me? Frankly, I have no idea! I'll likely be taking a little bit of time off to relax, spend time with family, and figure out what I want to do.
