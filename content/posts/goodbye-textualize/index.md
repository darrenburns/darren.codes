After three years of working full-time on Textual, it's finally time to move on and find a new challenge.

Over the course of three years, I've worked with some amazing colleagues, been part of a fantastic community of open-source developers, and had the opportunity to work on the most interesting projects of my career so far. We took Textual from a proof-of-concept to version 1.0 - a fully-featured open-source TUI framework - which can be used to build apps that push the boundaries of what is possible in the terminal. I feel incredibly privileged to have worked full-time on such a project. Despite no longer working full-time on it, I'll likely remain involved and active in the community, albeit at a far reduced capacity.

What's next for me? Frankly, I have no idea! I'm feeling refreshed after a break over the Christmas holidays, and excited to begin looking for new opportunities. So, if you (or your company!) are looking for an engineer experienced in Python, Java, API/framework development, distributed systems, and more, please get in touch with me at `darrenb900@gmail.com`! I'm open to remote work, or work based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
